					<h2>CIRCULATORY SYSTEM.</h2>
					<p>It’s a pathway for blood to flow through your body. Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to feed your body. These nutrients include glucose. <br> <span>What is glucose?</span> <br> <span>Glucose is your body’s fuel.</span></p>
					<p>Your body is constantly regulating the amount of glucose in your blood so you always have the energy you need. <br> This incredible process is managed by insulin. Insulin essentially acts as a key to unlock the door of your cell so that it can remove glucose from your body. That's how insulin naturally cotrols your blood sugar levels.</p>
					<p class="big__txt"><span>For most people, this process is so seamless, they don’t even realize it’s happening.</span></p>

					<p>As we know all too well, there are times when something goes wrong. Perhaps the body isn’t producing enough insulin to offset sugar intake. Or the blood cells aren’t complying well with insulin’s orders.  If this happens, glucose cannot exit the bloodstream.</p>
					<p class="weight__txt">Next thing you know, there’s a huge traffic jam of glucose in the bloodstream, one that keeps piling up.</p>
					<p>With no way to process the existing glucose, the glucose traffic jam grows, getting bigger and bigger. This build-up of glucose changes the blood from its normal ‘watery-like’ state into a thicker liquid, something more similar to <span>syrup</span> And if the amount of sugar in someone’s blood reaches a certain level, this person will be diagnosed a diabetic.</p>
					<p class="weight__txt">So, in a nutshell, diabetes is the body’s inability to process glucose.</p>

					<h6>Frequent Urination</h6>
					<p>As glucose builds up in the body, your kidneys remove some of it through urine (your kidneys are trying to help your insulin get the job done), making you dart for the bathroom more and more.</p>

					<h6>Oral Medications</h6>
				</div>
				<div class="content__treatment">
						<p><span>Most diabetics take oral diabetes medications.</span> Metformin is the most prescribed. It decreases the amount of glucose that you absorb from food and reduces the glucose produced by the liver. If the condition worsens, other oral drugs may be prescribed, including sulfonylureas, GLP1 agonists, DPP4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and others. </p>

				<div class="content__treatment">
						<p><span>Insulin injections are used to control blood glucose levels that are too high to be controlled by oral medications alone. </span> The insulin supplements what your body isn’t producing on its own. Unfortunately, insulin cannot be taken orally, meaning that insulin users have to inject themselves at least twice a day (or more!) depending on their blood sugar levels. A big disadvantage of insulin injections: modern, more effective forms of insulin are becoming increasingly unaffordable. Some insulin users have even started rationing their insulin because they cannot afford the correct amount. <span>Insulin costs have more than doubled in the last 5 years alone!</span></p>
